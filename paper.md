# Title
Model-measurement comparison of biomass burning aerosol
aging over West Africa


#Introduction
We present measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP,
as described in Bloggs et al 2004.
Mith et al (1998) conducted several studies
in this region, but continental-scale
measurements have not preaviously been made.

Add third paper in intro.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of BBOA over W Africa,
using John's model.
