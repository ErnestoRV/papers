Measurements of biomass burning aerosol over
West Africa

#Introduction
We present measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP,
as described in Bloggs et al 2004.
Mith et al (1998) conducted several studies
in this region, but continental-scale
measurements have not preaviously been made.
